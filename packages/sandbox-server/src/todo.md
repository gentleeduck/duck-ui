# ✅ FULL LIST OF QUESTIONS + ANSWERS

---

## 🧠 **1. System Design:**

### **Q:** Design a collaborative document editor (like Google Docs) for multiple users with real-time editing. How would you ensure consistency, performance, and fault tolerance?

### ✅ **Answer:**

**Tech Stack:**

* WebSocket or WebTransport for real-time connection
* Redis Pub/Sub or Kafka for broadcasting edits
* CRDT (e.g. Yjs, Automerge) for conflict-free merging
* Postgres or MongoDB for persistence
* Redis for caching
* Optional: OT if CRDT is not suitable

**Architecture Flow:**

1. Each client connects via WebSocket.
2. Edits are applied locally via CRDT, then broadcasted to the backend.
3. Backend pushes to Redis Pub/Sub or Kafka.
4. Subscribers (other clients or edge nodes) receive updates.
5. Save checkpointed states to Postgres every X seconds or on idle.

**Consistency:** CRDT ensures last-write-wins, no conflicts.
**Fault Tolerance:** Offline editing is possible, syncs when online. Redis can lose messages → use Kafka if strict delivery is required.

## 🔒 **2. Security in Microservices**

### **Q:** How would you ensure secure communication between microservices?

### ✅ **Answer:**

* **Authentication**: Each service issues and verifies **JWTs with scopes** or uses **mutual TLS (mTLS)**.
* **Authorization**: Use API Gateway (e.g., **Kong, Envoy, Nginx**) with OPA or Keycloak.
* **Secrets Management**: Use **Vault** or **AWS Secrets Manager** instead of `.env`.
* **Transport Security**: Enforce **TLS everywhere**, even inside the cluster.
* **Rate Limiting & DoS protection**: Apply at gateway level.

## 🗃️ **3. Database Scaling**

### **Q:** Suppose you have a Postgres database that’s becoming a bottleneck due to increasing traffic. What would you do?

### ✅ **Answer:**

1. **Analyze the workload** using pg\_stat\_statements or query profilers.
2. **Optimize slow queries**, use indexes.
3. **Use read replicas** for scaling read-heavy workloads.
4. **Cache frequent queries** with Redis.
5. **Partition tables** (time-based or hash-based).
6. **Shard the database** when vertical scaling no longer works (via Citus, Vitess, or custom routing).
7. **Use connection pooling** (e.g., PgBouncer) to handle too many connections.

---

## 💬 **4. Caching Strategy**

### **Q:** What types of caching would you use in a microservices architecture?

### ✅ **Answer:**

* **Client-side**: e.g. SWR or TanStack Query with cache invalidation.
* **Edge Caching**: CDN like Cloudflare or Fastly.
* **Application Layer**: Redis for:

  * Query results (`getOrSet` pattern)
  * Session tokens
  * Request de-duplication
* **Distributed Cache Coherency**:

  * Use **cache busting** strategies (e.g., `etag`, `versioned keys`)
  * Invalidate on writes, TTLs for eventual expiry
* **Avoid stale reads** by combining with version checks.

---

## 🔄 **5. Message Queueing & Async Processing**

### **Q:** When would you use RabbitMQ over Redis Pub/Sub or Kafka in microservices?

### ✅ **Answer:**

| Use Case          | RabbitMQ            | Redis Pub/Sub       | Kafka               |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Reliable delivery | ✅ (ACKs, retries)   | ❌ (fire-and-forget) | ✅ (replay support)  |
| Durability        | ✅ (queues)          | ❌                   | ✅                   |
| Scalability       | ⚠️ (limited)        | ✅ (lightweight)     | ✅ (high-throughput) |
| Ordering          | ⚠️ (FIFO per queue) | ❌                   | ✅ (per partition)   |
| Best for          | Task queues         | Real-time chat      | Event sourcing      |

**Conclusion**: Use RabbitMQ for **job queues**, Kafka for **event streaming**, and Redis Pub/Sub for **simple broadcasts**.
