# ✅ Atom State Management – Full Todo List

### 📦 Core Functionality

* [ ] `atom(value)` – primitive atom
* [ ] `atom(get => ...)` – read-only derived atom
* [ ] `atom(get, set)` – writable derived atom
* [ ] `atom(initial, write)` – write-only atom
* [ ] `async () => ...` – async atoms (support Suspense)
* [ ] `setSelf` for async or imperative resolution
* [ ] `Getter(atom)`, `Setter(atom, val)` context functions
* [ ] Prevent unnecessary recomputes
* [ ] Atom identity tracking (for deduplication/comparison)

---

### 🧵 React Integration

* [ ] `useAtom(atom)` – value + setter
* [ ] `useAtomValue(atom)` – value only
* [ ] `useSetAtom(atom)` – setter only
* [ ] `useSyncExternalStore` integration
* [ ] Suspense + error handling (with async atoms)

---

### 🧠 Reactivity Engine (Minimal Graph)

* [ ] Reactive graph: track which atom reads which atom
* [ ] Auto-recompute derived atoms only when dependencies change
* [ ] Dispose old subscriptions when dependencies change
* [ ] Auto-cleanup for async computations (on abort)

---

### 🔬 Fine-Grained Reactivity (Advanced)

* [ ] Proxy-based field tracking (track `user.name` only)
* [ ] Re-render only when the accessed field changes
* [ ] Replace full-object writes with diff patching (optional)

---

### 🔄 Update System

* [ ] Manual `batch(() => ...)` function to group updates
* [ ] Queue update notifications and flush once
* [ ] Flush on next microtask or animation frame (configurable)

---

### 🧪 Effects / Side Effects

* [ ] `effect(() => get(atom))` – outside React
* [ ] Optional cleanup functions from effects
* [ ] Run effect only when dependencies change

---

### 🧰 Developer Experience

* [ ] Devtools: log atom reads/writes
* [ ] Show dependency graph
* [ ] Atom change timeline (atom logs)
* [ ] Support for debug labels per atom (`atom.debugLabel = "count"`)

---

### 🪣 Store and Scope

* [ ] `createStore()` – instantiate isolated store
* [ ] `Provider` component for React store scoping
* [ ] Scoped atoms per React tree
* [ ] Hydration for SSR/Next.js (optional)

---

### 🗃 Persistence & External Sync

* [ ] `persistAtom(atom, options)` – sync to localStorage/sessionStorage
* [ ] Sync atom to query string or hash
* [ ] Atom hydration from storage or custom sources

---

### 🧠 Atom Families & Parameterized Atoms

* [ ] `atomFamily(param => atom(...))`
* [ ] Memoization of families with LRU (configurable size)
* [ ] Async-safe atomFamily

---

### 🔁 Selectors / Lens Support

* [ ] `selectAtom(atom, selector)` for sub-value tracking
* [ ] Partial writes with `setAtomSubset(atom, path, value)`
* [ ] Deep merge updates (optional)

---

### 🧩 Middleware and Plugin System

* [ ] `onWrite(atom, fn)` – middleware to run before/after write
* [ ] `onRead(atom, fn)` – hook into reads (for logging/validation)
* [ ] Plugin system to extend atoms (e.g., devtools, logger, storage)

---

### 🧱 Snapshot & Debugging

* [ ] `getSnapshot()` – return current state of all atoms
* [ ] `restoreSnapshot(snapshot)` – restore previous state
* [ ] Time-travel debugging (with optional devtools)

---

### ⏱ Cache and Lifetime Management

* [ ] Atom TTL: expire after N ms
* [ ] Invalidate atom manually: `invalidate(atom)`
* [ ] Lazy atoms: compute only on first read
* [ ] Auto dispose atoms if not used (GC-safe mode)

---

### 📦 Packaging & Distribution

* [ ] Bundle size under 3kb (target)
* [ ] ESM + CJS builds
* [ ] Tree-shakable
* [ ] TypeScript-first with strict typings
* [ ] React 18+ and 19-ready

---

### Optional Extras

* [ ] Observable/Signal bridge (to reuse signals inside atoms)
* [ ] Custom equality function per atom
* [ ] Dev mode warnings for stale reads

---
